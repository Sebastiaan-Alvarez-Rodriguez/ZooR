# ZooR
Simple tool to download [Androzoo](https://androzoo.uni.lu/) apk's from their dataset.
Even though [ArtemKushnerov](https://github.com/ArtemKushnerov/) made [this](https://github.com/ArtemKushnerov/az) great tool, I had to make ZooR. His tool works with python3.6 and higher only, and requires non-standard python packages.  
That is why this package is very useful for people who have access to large servers, but do not have root access there (as `python pip` installations require root... or virtual environments, but we all know how slow those are)

# Requirements
You will need all of the following
 * GNU Linux to run on
 * Python v3.3 or newer (preferably the latest version compatible with python3)

# Installation
1. Install above requirements (if you do not have them already)
2. `git clone` this repository

# Usage
Run `run.py` with python and choose whatever you want. 
From that point, you will be asked what kind of apk's you wish to download, how many, and where to store them.

The apk's are stored by their md5 checksums
